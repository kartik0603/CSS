        India’s jobs crisis is a serious and persistent problem that affects
        millions of young and educated people who are unable to find suitable
        employment in the formal economy. According to the Centre for Monitoring
        Indian Economy (CMIE), an independent think tank, India’s unemployment
        rate was more than 7% for most of 2021 and 2022, and reached 7.9% in
        December 2022. This is much higher than the global average and most of
        the emerging economies.!

      <p id="line">
        As an economy grows, it is generally seen that it also becomes more
        productive. That is, in the process of producing a greater amount of
        total output, firms become capable of producing more output per worker.
        This happens because of what economists call “economies of scale”.
      </p>

      <p>
        As firms produce more output, they find it easier to adopt labour-saving
        technologies. But the extent to which labour-saving technologies are
        introduced depends on the bargaining power of labour.

        <p> <b>The Keynesian Theory</b> : The central contribution of the Keynesian revolution in macroeconomics was to highlight the role of aggregate demand as the binding constraint on employment.</p>
        <p>Fiscal policy was perceived to increase labour demand by stimulating output. The developing countries that inherited a dual economy structure during their independence, confronted additional constraints on output.</p>

                                <b>Implement a National Employment Policy (NEP)</b> : The evidence suggests that the employment challenge can no longer be met only through more rapid GDP growth. Rather, a separate policy focus is needed on employment in addition to the focus on GDP growth.

                    <li>Such employment policies will need both demand side and supply side components.</li>

                    <li>For example, to the extent firms in India find it easier to automate due to a lack of public provisioning of education and health of adequate skilled labour, increasing the quality of the workforce through better care, as well as bridging the skills gap, are important</li>
